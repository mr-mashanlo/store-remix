# E-commerce Store (Remix.js)

Minimalist e-commerce web application built with [Remix.js](https://remix.run).

The project is currently under active development.

Design is intentionally clean and minimal â€” crafted by me to focus on usability and performance.

- Product pages with dynamic routing
- Shopping cart
- User authentication
- Admin dashboard (optional)

## Stack

- [Remix.js](https://remix.run)
